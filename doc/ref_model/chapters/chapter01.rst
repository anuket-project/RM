Introduction
============

Overview
--------

The Reference Model (RM) specifies a virtualisation technology-agnostic (VM-based and container-based) cloud
infrastructure abstraction. It acts as a catalogue of the exposed infrastructure capabilities, resources, and
interfaces required by the workloads. This document has been developed by the Linux Foundation Networking project
:cite:p:`anuket-overview`.

**Problem statement:** Based on community consultations, including Telco operators, technology suppliers, and software
developers, it is understood that there are significant technical, operational, and business challenges to the
development and deployment of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) and Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF), due to the
lack of standard cloud infrastructure specifications, viz. cloud infrastructure platform characteristics and features. 
These include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Higher development costs, due to the need to develop virtualised/cloud-native network applications on
  operator-specific custom platforms.
- Increased complexities, due to the need to maintain multiple versions of applications to support each custom
  environment.
- Lack of testing and validation commonalities, leading to inefficiencies and increased time to market. While the
  operators will still perform internal testing, the application developers utilising an industry standard verification
  program on a common cloud infrastructure would lead to efficiencies and faster time to market.
- Slower adoption of cloud-native applications and architectures. A common Telco cloud specification may provide an
  easier path to methodologies that will drive faster cloud-native development.
- Increased operational overheads, due to the need for operators to integrate diverse and sometimes conflicting cloud
  platform requirements.

One of the main challenges holding back the more rapid and widespread adoption of virtualised/cloud-native network
applications is when, while building or designing their virtualised services, specific infrastructure assumptions and
requirements are implied, often with custom design parameters. This forces the operators to build complex integrations
of various vendor-/function-specific silos which are incompatible with each other and might possibly have differing and
conflicting operating models. This also makes the onboarding and conformance processes of the VNFs/CNFs (coming from
different vendors) hard to automate and standardise. There is a clear need for a common model across the industry to
facilitate more rapid adoption.

This document starts from the abstract and, as it progresses, becomes more detailed. It follows the traditional design
process where you start from the core principles, progress to abstract concepts and models, and then finish with
operational considerations, such as security and lifecycle management.

Scope
-----

This **Reference Model** document focuses on identifying the abstractions and associated concepts that are needed to
represent the cloud infrastructure. See :numref:`scope-of-reference-model` for the scope of the Reference Model.

   Scope of the Reference Model

This document specifies the following:

- **Cloud infrastructure abstraction**: In context with how it interacts with the other components required to build
  a complete cloud system that supports workloads deployed in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Network function
  workloads that are deployed on virtual machines and containers are referred to as virtual network functions (VNFs)
  and cloud-native network functions (CNFs), respectively.

  **Note:** CNFs are now more commonly referred to as cloud-native network functions.
  
  - **Cloud infrastructure capabilities and metrics**: This is a set of cloud infrastructure capabilities and metrics
    required to perform Telco scale network functions, and satisfy their performance criteria.
  - **Infrastructure profiles catalogue**: This is a catalogue of standard infrastructure software and hardware
    configurations, referred to as profiles. These profiles abstract the infrastructure for the workloads. Only a few
    profiles, with well-defined characteristics, can meet the operational and performance requirements of all the
    workloads.

- **Cloud infrastructure software and hardware profiles**:

  - **Cloud infrastructure software profiles**: These software profiles are components of the corresponding
    infrastructure profiles within the infrastructure profiles catalogue. They specify the host infrastructure
    software configurations.
  - **Cloud infrastructure hardware profiles**: These hardware profiles are components of the corresponding
    infrastructure profiles within the infrastructure profiles catalogue. They specify the host infrastructure
    hardware configurations.

- **Conformance and verification**:

  - **Conformance programs**: These define the requirements for verification and validation programs for the cloud
    infrastructure and workloads.
  - **Test framework**: This document provides the input for the test suites to allow the conformance of the cloud
    infrastructure and the workloads.

To help guide the reader, the Anuket Glossary :cite:p:`anuket-glossary` provides an introduction to the main terms used
within this document and throughout the project as a whole. These definitions are, with a few exceptions, based on the
ETSI GR NFV 003 :cite:p:`etsigrnfv003` definitions. In a few cases, they have been modified to avoid deployment
technology dependencies, only when it is necessary to avoid confusion.
