## Results Reporting

Test suites will be categorized as functional or performance based. Results reporting will be communicated as a boolean (pass/fail). The pass/fail determination for performance-based test cases will be made by comparing results against a baseline.
Example performance-based metrics include, but are not limited to: resource utilization, response times, latency, sustained throughput per second (TPS).
