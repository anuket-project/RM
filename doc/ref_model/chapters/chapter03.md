# 3	Infrastructure Abstraction

There is the necessity to clearly define which kind of infrastructure resources a shared network function virtualisation infrastructure (NFVI) will provide for hosting virtual network functions (VNFs) and/or cloud-native network functions (CNF), so that the requirements of each of the VNFs and CNFs match the capabilities of the NFVI.

The lack of a common understanding of which resources and corresponding capabilities a suitable NFVI should provide may lead to several issues which could negatively impact the time and cost for onboarding and maintaining these solutions on top of a virtualised infrastructure e.g.:
- supporting any kind of VNF specific requirements (e.g. regarding network acceleration or API access) might result in having to establish different silo NFVIs for each VNF
- synchronising the release cycles of a large set of different technologies will sooner or later lead to situations in which required upgrades cannot be applied easily due to incompatibilities.

The abstraction model presented in this chapter specifies a common set of virtual infrastructure resources which a NFVI will need to provide to be able to host most of the typical VNF workloads required by the operator community.
Although a couple of explicit and implicit abstraction models (e.g. in the context of ETSI/NFV) are already available they fall short when address following design principles:
-	**Scope**: the model should describe the most relevant virtualised infrastructure resources (incl. acceleration technologies) an NFVI needs to provide for hosting Telco VNF workloads
-	**Separation of Concern**: the model should support a clear distinction between the responsibilities related to maintaining the network function virtualisation infrastructure and the responsibilities related to managing the various VNF workloads
-	**Simplicity**: the amount of different types of resources (including their attributes and relationships amongst one another) should be kept to a minimum to reduce the configuration spectrum which needs to be considered
-	**Declarative**: the model should allow for a declarative description of the required NFVI capabilities for onboarding and maintaining VNFs
-	**Explicit**: the model needs to be rich enough to allow for a direct mapping towards the APIs of NFVIs for the instantiation of virtual infrastructure elements without requiring any additional parameters
-	**Lifecycle**: the model must distinguish between resources which have independent lifecycles but should group together those resources which share a common lifecycle
-	**Aligned**: the model should clearly highlight the dependencies between the elements to allow for a well-defined and simplified synchronisation of independent automation tasks.

To summarise: the abstraction model presented in this paper will build upon existing modelling concepts and simplify and streamline them to the needs of telco operators who intend to distinguish between infrastructure related and VNF related responsibilities.

## 3.1	Model
The abstraction model for the NFVI makes use of following layers (only the virtual infrastructure layer will be directly exposed to the VNFs/CNFs):
