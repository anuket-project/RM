# 2	VNF requirements & Analysis

The NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) is the totality of all hardware and software components which build up the environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and executed.

It is inevitable that different VNFs require different capabilities from the underlying infrastructure and therefore metrics that define those capabilities are needed.
