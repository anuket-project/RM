<p>Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors are everywhere. The telecom industry and its cloud infrastructures are
especially vulnerable to potential attacks due to the ubiquitous nature of the infrastructures and services, combined
with the vital role telecommunications play in the modern world. The attack vectors are many and varied, ranging
from the potential for exposure of sensitive data, both personal and corporate, to weaponized disruption to the
global telecommunications networks. These threats can take the form of physical attacks on the locations where the
infrastructure hardware is housed, to network attacks, such as denial of service and targeted corruption of the
network service applications themselves. Whatever the source, a Cloud Infrastructure needs to be able to withstand
attacks in whatever form they take.</p>
<p>This chapter examines multiple aspects of security, as it relates to cloud infrastructure and security aspects for
workloads. After discussing security attack vectors, this chapter delves into the security requirements. Regarding
security requirements and best practices, specifications and documents are published by standards organisations. A
selection of standards of interest for cloud infrastructure security is listed in a dedicated section. This chapter
culminates with a consolidated set of requirements recommendations. It is suggested that operators carefully evaluate
the recommendations for possible implementation.</p>

<h2>Potential attack vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-attack-vectors" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Previously, attacks designed to place and migrate workloads outside the legal boundaries were not possible using the
traditional infrastructure, due to the closed nature of these systems. However, using cloud infrastructure, violation
of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by actors diverting or moving an application from an authenticated and
legal location to a potentially illegal location. The consequences of violating regulatory policies may take the
form of a complete banning of service and/or an exaction of a financial penalty by a governmental agency or through SLA
enforcement. Such vectors of attack may be the original intention of the attacker in an effort to harm the service
provider. One possible attack scenario is when an attacker exploits the insecure NF API to dump personal data records
from the database, in an attempt to violate user privacy. Cloud infrastructure operators should ensure that the APIs are
secure and accessible over a secure network (transport layer security or TLS), under strict set of security best practices
and RBAC policies to limit exposure of this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Typical cloud-associated attacker tactics have been identified in the widely accepted
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/getting-started-with-attack-october-2019.pdf">MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Framework</a>. This framework provides a systematic approach to capture adversarial tactics targeting cloud

<h3>Common security standards<a class="headerlink" href="#common-security-standards" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Cloud Infrastructure Reference Model and the supporting architectures are not only required to optimally support
networking functions. They must also be designed, from inception, with common security principles and standards. These
best practices must be applied at all layers of the infrastructure stack and across all points of interconnection
(internal or with outside networks), APIs, and contact points with the NFV network functions overlaying or interacting
with that infrastructure.</p>
<p>A good place to start to understand the security requirements is to use the following widely accepted definitions and
core principles developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Confidentiality: only allow access to data which the user is permitted to view.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity: ensure the data has not been tampered with or altered by unauthorised users.</p></li>
<li><p>Availability: ensure the systems and data are available to authorised users when they need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These three principles are complemented for cloud infrastructure security by authenticity. Authenticity refers to the
ability to confirm that the users are valid and have the correct rights to access the systems or data.</p>
<p>Standards organisations with recommendations and best practices, and certifications that need to be taken into
consideration, include the following examples. This is not an exhaustive list, it contains only some of the more
important standards in current use.</p>

<h3>General platform security<a class="headerlink" href="#general-platform-security" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The security certification of the platform typically needs to be the same as, or higher than, the workload requirements.</p>
<p>The platform supports the workload, and in effect controls access to the workload to and from the external endpoints,
such as carriage networks used by workloads, by data centre operations staff supporting the workload, or by tenants
accessing workloads. From an access security perspective, the following diagram shows where the different access controls
operate within the platform to provide access controls throughout the platform.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>MGMT ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These provide platform access to workloads for service management. Typically, all management
and control-plane traffic is encrypted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DATA ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These control the east-west traffic between workloads and control of north-south traffic
between the network function (NF) and other platform services, such as front-end carriage networks and platform services.
Inherently strong separation between tenants is mandatory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SERVICES ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These protect the platform services from any platform access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACK-END ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These provide data centre operations access to the platform, and subsequently, the
workloads. Typically, stronger authent,ication, such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), is required, as well as the use
of technologies, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and encryption. Application Programming Interface (API)
gateways may be required for automated/script-driven processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRONT-END ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These protect the platform from malicious carriage network access and provide
connectivity for specific workloads to specific carriage networks. Carriage networks are those networks that are
provided as public networks and are operated by carriers, in this case with interfaces that are usually subnetworks or
virtual networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TENANT ACCESS CONTROLS</strong> - These provide appropriate tenant access controls to specific platform services and tenant
workloads. These controls include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), authentication controls as appropriate for the

<p><strong>Vulnerability management</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Security defects must be reported.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cloud Infrastructure components must be continuously analysed from deployment to runtime. The cloud infrastructure
must offer tools to check the code libraries and all other code against the
<a class="reference external" href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases</a> to identify the presence of any
known vulnerabilities. The CVE is a list of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures that is maintained by
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>. Each vulnerability is characterised by an identifier, a description, a date, and
comments.</p></li>
<li><p>When a vulnerability is discovered on a component (from operating systems to virtualisation layer components), the
remediation action depends on its severity. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a> allows you to calculate a vulnerability score. It is an open framework widely used in
vulnerability management tools. The CVSS is owned and managed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams
(FIRST). The CVSS consists of three metric groups: base, temporal, and environmental. The base metrics produce a score
ranging from 0 to 10. This score can then be refined using temporal and environmental metrics. The numerical score can
be translated into a qualitative representation of the severity: low, medium, high, or critical. The severity score
(or the associated qualitative representation) allows organisations to prioritise the remediation activities, with high
scores mandating a fast response time. The vulnerable components must then be patched or replaced, or their access must
be restricted.</p></li>
<li><p>Security patches must be obtained from an authorised source, to ensure their integrity. Patches must be tested and
validated in a preproduction environment before being deployed into production.</p></li>

<h3>Infrastructure as a Code security<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-as-a-code-security" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC), alternatively known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), refers to the software used
for the declarative management of the cloud infrastructure resources. To dynamically address user requirements,
release features incrementally, and deliver more speedily, DevSecOps teams use best practices, including continuous
integration and delivery, and integrate information security controls and scanning tools into these processes, with
with the aim of providing timely and meaningful feedback. This includes identifying vulnerabilities and security
policy violations. With these automated security testing and analysis capabilities, it is of critical value in
detecting vulnerabilities early and maintaining a consistent security policy.</p>
<p>Because of the high complexity of modern Telco cloud infrastructures, even minor IaaC code changes could
disproportionately and sometimes disastrously affect downstream security and privacy. Therefore, the integration of
security testing into the IaaC software development pipeline requires security activities to be automated using
security tools, and integrated with the native DevOps and DevSecOps tools and procedures.</p>
<p>The DevSecOps Automation best practices advocate, among other things, the implementation of a framework for security
automation and programmatic execution, as well as the monitoring of security controls to identify, protect, detect,
respond, and recover from cyber threats. The framework used for IaaC security is based on the joint publication of
the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and SAFECode,

<p>The framework identifies the following five distinct stages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Secure design and architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure coding (developer IDE and code repository).</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous build, integration, and testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous delivery and deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous monitoring and runtime defence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Triggers and checkpoints define transitions within stages. When designing DevSecOps security processes, it should be
borne in mind that when a trigger condition is met, one or more security activities is activated. The outcomes of these
security activities need to determine whether or not the requirements of the process checkpoint are satisfied. If the
outcome of the security activities meets the requirements, the next set of security activities is performed as the
process transition to the next checkpoint, or, alternatively, to the next stage, if the checkpoint is the last one in
the current stage. If, however, the outcome of the security activities does not meet the requirements, then the
process should not be allowed to advance to the next checkpoint. In
“<a class="reference internal" href="#consolidated-security-requirements"><span class="std std-ref">Consolidated security requirements</span></a>”, the IaaC security activities are presented as security
requirements mapped to particular stages and trigger points.</p>

<section id="security-of-production-and-non-production-environments">
<h3>Security of production and non-production environments<a class="headerlink" href="#security-of-production-and-non-production-environments" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Telecommunications operators often focus their security efforts on the production environments actively used by their
customers or their employees, or both. This is critical because a breach of these systems can seriously damage the
company and its customers. In addition, production systems often contain the most valuable data, making them attractive
targets for intruders. However, an insecure non-production (development and testing) environment can also create real
problems because they may leave a company open to corporate espionage, sabotage by competitors, and theft of sensitive
data.</p>
<p>Security is about mitigating risk. If operators do not have the same level of security in their non-production
environments compared to production, then an additional level of risk may be introduced. This is especially true if
such non-production environments accept outside connections (for example, for suppliers or partners, which is quite
normal in complex Telco ecosystems). There is a need to monitor the security of these non-production environments. The
gold standard, therefore, is to implement the same security policies in production and non-production infrastructure.
This would reduce risk and typically simplify operations by using the same control tools and processes. However, for
practical reasons, some of the security monitoring rules may differ. As an example, if a company maintains a separate,
isolated environment for infrastructure software development experimentation, the configuration monitoring rules may
be relaxed, in comparison with the production environment, where such experimentation is not allowed. Therefore, in
this document, when dealing with such dilemmas, the focus has been placed on those non-production security requirements
that must be on the same level as in the production environment (typically of <strong>must</strong> type), leaving relaxed
requirements (typically of <strong>should</strong> or <strong>may</strong>) in cases where there is no such necessity.</p>
<p>In the context of contemporary telecommunications technology, the cloud infrastructure typically is considered
Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC). This fact implies that many aspects of code-related security automatically apply to
IaaC. Security aspects of IaaC in the Telco context are discussed in
“<a class="reference internal" href="#infrastructure-as-a-code-security"><span class="std std-ref">Infrastructure as a Code security</span></a>”, which introduces the relevant framework for security
automation and programmatic execution, as well as monitoring of security controls. Organisations need to identify which
of the stages, or activities within these stages, should be performed within the non-production versus production
environments. This mapping will then dictate which security activities defined for particular stages and triggers
(such as vulnerability tests, patch testing, and penetration tests) are mandatory, and which can be regarded as
discretionary.</p>

<section id="remote-attestation-opencit">
<h3>Remote attestation/OpenCIT<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-attestation-opencit" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cloud infrastructure operators must ensure that remote attestation methods are used to remotely verify the trust status
of a given cloud infrastructure platform. The concept is based on boot integrity measurements leveraging the Trusted
Platform Module (TPM) built into the underlying hardware. Remote attestation can be provided as a service. It may be
used by the platform owner or by a customer to verify that the platform has booted in a trusted manner. Practical
implementations of the remote attestation service include the Open Cloud Integrity Tool (OpenCIT). OpenCIT provides
‘Trust’ visibility of the cloud infrastructure. It enables compliance in cloud datacenters by establishing the root
of trust, and builds a chain of trust across hardware, operating system, hypervisor, virtual machines, and containers.
It includes asset tagging for location and boundary control. The platform trust and asset tag attestation information
is used by orchestrators and/or policy compliance management to ensure workloads are launched on trusted and location-
or boundary-compliant platforms. They provide the necessary visibility and auditability of infrastructure in both
public and private cloud environments.</p>
</section>
<section id="workload-image">
<h3>Workload image<a class="headerlink" href="#workload-image" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Only workload images from trusted sources may be used. Secrets must be stored outside the images.</p>
<p>It is easy to tamper with workload images. It requires only a few seconds to insert some malware into a workload image
file while it is being uploaded to an image database or transferred from an image database to a compute node. To guard
against this danger, workload images must be cryptographically signed and verified during launch time. This can be
achieved by setting up a signing authority and modifying the hypervisor configuration to verify an image’s signature
before it is launched.</p>
<p>To implement image security, the workload operator must test the image and the supplementary components, to verify that
everything conforms to the security policies and best practices. The use of image scanners, such as OpenSCAP or Trivy,
to determine security vulnerabilities is recommended.</p>
<p>CIS hardened images should be used whenever possible. CIS provides, for example, virtual machine hardened images based
on CIS benchmarks for various operating systems. Another best practice is to use minimalist base images whenever
possible.</p>
<p>Images are stored in registries. The images registry must contain vetted images only. The registry must remain a source
of trust for images over time. Images must therefore be continuously scanned to identify vulnerabilities and out-of-date
versions, as described previously. Access to the registry is an important security risk. It must be granted by a
dedicated authorisation process and through secure networks that enforce authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.</p>
</section>
<section id="networking-security-zoning">
<h3>Networking security zoning<a class="headerlink" href="#networking-security-zoning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Network segmentation is important for ensuring that applications can only communicate with those applications with
which they are supposed to communicate. To prevent a workload from impacting other workloads or hosts, it is good
practice to separate workload traffic and management traffic. This prevents attacks by VMs or containers breaking
into the management infrastructure. It is also best to separate the VLAN traffic into appropriate groups and disable
all other VLANs that are not in use. Likewise, workloads of similar functionalities can be grouped into specific zones
and their traffic isolated. Each zone can be protected using access control policies and a dedicated firewall based on
the required security level.</p>
<p>It is recommended to set network security policies following the principle of least privileged, only allowing
approved protocol flows. For example, set ‘default deny’ for inbound flows and add the approved policies required for
the functioning of the application running on the NFV infrastructure.</p>
</section>
<section id="volume-encryption">
<h3>Volume encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#volume-encryption" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Virtual volume disks associated with workloads may contain sensitive data. Therefore, they need to be protected.
It is best practice is to secure the workload volumes by encrypting them and storing the cryptographic keys in safe
locations. Encryption functions rely on a cloud infrastructure internal key management service. Be aware that the
decision to encrypt the volumes might cause reduced performance. Therefore, the decision to encrypt needs to be
dependent on the requirements of the given infrastructure. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) module can also be used
to store these keys securely. The hypervisor should also be configured to securely erase the virtual volume disks,
in the event of application crashes, or in case it is intentionally destroyed to protect it from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>For sensitive data encryption, when data sovereignty is required, an external Hardware Security Module (HSM) should
be integrated, in order to protect the cryptographic keys. A HSM is a physical device which manages and stores
secrets. Usage of an HSM strengthens the security of the secrets. For 5G services, GSMA FASG recommends the
implementation of an HSM to secure the storage of the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) credentials.</p>

<section id="root-of-trust-for-measurements">
<h3>Root of trust for measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#root-of-trust-for-measurements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following sections define the mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the infrastructure pre-boot and post-boot
(running). The following definitions detail a set of terms used in those sections.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The hardware root of trust helps with the pre-boot and post-boot security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) adheres to standards defined by an industry consortium. Vendors
(hardware and software) and solution providers collaborate to define common interfaces, protocols, and structures
for computing platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>The Platform Configuration Register (PCR) is a memory location in the TPM that is used to store TPM Measurements
(hash values generated by the SHA-1 standard hashing algorithm). The PCRs are cleared only on TPM reset. UEFI
defines 24 PCRs, of which the first 16, PCR 0 - PCR 15, are used to store measures created during the UEFI boot
process.</p></li>
<li><p>The Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM) is a computing engine that is capable of making integrity measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>The Core Root of Trust for Measurements (CRTM) is a set of instructions executed when performing an RTM.</p></li>
<li><p>Platform Attestation provides proof of validity of the platform’s integrity measurements. For details, see
“<a class="reference internal" href="#remote-attestation-opencit"><span class="std std-ref">Remote attestation/OpenCIT</span></a>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Values stored in a PCR cannot be reset (or forged), as they can only be extended. Whenever a measurement is sent to a
TPM, the hash of the concatenation of the current value of the PCR and the new measurement is stored in the PCR. The PCR
values are used to encrypt data. If the proper environment is not loaded, which will result in different PCR values, the
TPM will be unable to decrypt the data.</p>
<section id="static-root-of-trust-for-measurement">
<h4>Static Root of Trust for Measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#static-root-of-trust-for-measurement" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM) begins with measuring and verifying the integrity of the BIOS firmware.
It then measures additional firmware modules, verifies their integrity, and adds each component’s measure to an SRTM
value. The final value represents the expected state of the boot path loads. The SRTM stores the results as one or more
values stored in PCR storage. In the SRTM, the CRTM resets PCRs 0 to 15 only at boot.</p>
<p>Using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as a hardware root of trust, measurements of platform components, such as
firmware, bootloader, and OS kernel, can be securely stored and verified. Cloud infrastructure operators should ensure
that the TPM support is enabled in the platform firmware, so that the platform measurements are correctly recorded
during boot time.</p>
<p>A simple process works in the following way:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The BIOS CRTM (Bios Boot Block) is executed by the CPU and is used to measure the BIOS firmware.</p></li>
<li><p>The SHA1 hash of the result of the measurement is sent to the TPM.</p></li>
<li><p>The TPM stores this new result hash by extending the currently stored value.</p></li>
<li><p>The hash comparisons can validate settings, as well as the integrity of the modules.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Cloud infrastructure operators should ensure that OS kernel measurements can be recorded by using a TPM-aware
bootloader (for example, tboot, (see <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/</a>)
or shim, (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rhboot/shim">https://github.com/rhboot/shim</a>)), which can extend the root
of trust up to the kernel level.</p>
<p>The validation of the platform measurements can be performed by the TPM’s launch control policy (LCP) or through
the remote attestation server.</p>
</section>
<section id="dynamic-root-of-trust-for-measurement">
<h4>Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-root-of-trust-for-measurement" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM), the RTM for the running environment is stored in the PCRs
starting with PCR 17.</p>
<p>If a remote attestation server is used to monitor platform integrity, the operators should ensure that the
attestation is performed periodically or in a timely manner. Additionally, platform monitoring can be extended to
monitor the integrity of the static file system at run-time by using a TPM-aware kernel module, such as Linux
Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). For details, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home">https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home</a>. Alternatively,
you can use the trust policies functionality of OpenCIT.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opencit/opencit/wiki/Open-CIT-3.2-Product-Guide">https://github.com/opencit/opencit/wiki/Open-CIT-3.2-Product-Guide</a> for details.</p>
<p>The static file system includes a set of important files and folders which do not change between reboots during the
platform’s lifecycle. This allows the attestation server to detect any tampering with the static file system during
the platform’s runtime.</p>

<section id="zero-trust-architecture">
<h3>Zero Trust Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-trust-architecture" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The sections “<a class="reference internal" href="#remote-attestation-opencit"><span class="std std-ref">Remote attestation/OpenCIT</span></a>” and
“<a class="reference internal" href="#root-of-trust-for-measurements"><span class="std std-ref">Root of trust for measurements</span></a>” provide
methods to ensure the integrity of the infrastructure. The Zero Trust concept goes a step further, by enabling
the operator to build secure by design cloud infrastructure, from hardware to applications. The adoption of
Zero Trust principles mitigates the threats and attacks within an enterprise, a network, or an infrastructure,
thereby ensuring a fine grained segmentation between each component of the system.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">NIST SP 800-207 publication</a> <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter01.html#id35" title="Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). NIST SP 800-207. URL: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf.">38</a>]</span>, assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or
user accounts, whatever their location or ownership. The Zero Trust approach focuses on protecting all types of resources:
data, services, devices, infrastructure components, and virtual and cloud components. Trust is never granted implicitly,
and must be evaluated continuously.</p>
<p>The ZTA principles applied to the cloud infrastructure components are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The adoption of least privilege configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>The requirement of authentication and authorization for each entity, service, or session.</p></li>
<li><p>Fine-grained segmentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Separation of the control plane and the data plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure internal and external communications.</p></li>
<li><p>The continuous monitoring, testing, and analysing of security.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Zero Trust principles should also be applied to cloud-native applications. With the increasing use of these applications,
which are designed with microservices and deployed using containers as packaging and Kubernetes as an orchestrator, the
security of east-west communications between components must be carefully addressed. The use of secured communication
protocols brings a first level of security. However, considering each component as non-trustworthy will minimize the risk
for applications to be compromised. A good practice is to implement the proxy-based service mesh. This will provide a
framework to build a secured environment for microservices-based applications, offering services such as service
discovery, authentication and authorisation policies enforcement, network resilience, and security monitoring
capabilities. The two documents,

<section id="open-source-software-security">
<h3>Open-source software security<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-software-security" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Open-source code is present in cloud infrastructure software from BIOS and host operating systems to virtualisation
layer components. The most obvious is represented by Linux, KVM, QEMU, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. Workloads
components can also be composed of open-source code. The proportion of open-source code to an application source code
can vary. It can be partial or total, visible or invisible. Open-source code can be upstream code coming directly
from open-source public repositories, or code within a commercial application or network function.</p>
<p>The strength of open-source code is the availability of code source developed by a community which maintains and
improves it. Integration of open-source code with application source code helps to develop and produce applications
faster. This could, however, introduce security risks if a risk management DevSecOps approach is not implemented.
The GSMA white paper  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/resources/open-networking-the-security-of-open-source-software-deployment/">“Open Networking &amp; the Security of Open Source Software Deployment - Future Networks”</a>
highlights these risks and addresses the challenges coming with open-source code usage. Among the security risks are
poor code quality containing security flaws, an obsolete code with known vulnerabilities, and the lack of knowledge
of the branch activity of the open-source communities. An active branch comes with bugs fixes. This is not the case
with an inactive branch. The GSMA white paper develops means to mitigate these security issues.</p>
<p>Poor code quality is a risk factor. One advantage of open-source code is its transparency. Code can be inspected using

<h3>Software Bill of Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#software-bill-of-materials" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To ensure software security, it is crucial to identify the software components and their origins. The
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), described by the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration
<a class="reference external" href="https://ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials">US NTIA</a>, is a recommended tool for identifying software
components. The SBOM is an inventory of software components and the relationships between them. The NTIA describes
how to establish an SBOM and provides SBOM standard data formats. In the event of vulnerability being detected in a
component, the SBOM inventory is an effective means of identifying the impacted component and of enabling
remediation.</p>
<p>A transparent software supply chain offers benefits for the remediation of vulnerabilities. It also offers benefits
for licensing management and provides assurance of the source and integrity of the components. To achieve and
benefit from this transparency, a shared model must be supported by industry. This is the goal of the work
performed by the US Department of Commerce and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
and published, in the report <a class="reference external" href="https://ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf">“The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)”</a>, in July 2021. This document gives
guidance and specifies the minimum elements for the SBOM as a starting point.</p>
<p>A piece of software can be modelled as a hierarchical tree with components and subcomponents. Each
component should have its SBOM, including, as a baseline, the information detailed in the following table.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">

<p>For more details about each data field, see the NTIA SBOM document. Examples of commonly used identifiers are
provided.</p>
<p>To use SBOMs efficiently and encourage their widespread adoption, information must be generated and shared in a
standard format. This format must be machine-readable, to allow automation. Proprietary formats should not be used.
Multiple data formats exist covering baseline SBOM information. The three key formats, Software Package Data
eXchange (SPDX), CycloneDX, and Software Identification Tags (SWID tags), are interoperable for the core data
fields and use common data syntax representations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a> is an open-source machine-readable format developed under the umbrella of the Linux
Foundation. <a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/">SPDX specification 2.2</a> has been published as the standard
ISO/IEC 5962:2021. It provides a language for communicating the data, licenses, copyrights, and security
information associated with software components. With SPDX specification 2.2, multiple file formats are available:
YAML, JSON, RDF/XML, tag:value flat text, and xls spreadsheets.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a> was designed in 2017 for use with the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) Dependency-Track tool, an open-source component analysis platform that identifies risk in the software
supply chain. CycloneDX supports a wide range of software components, including applications, containers,
libraries, files, firmware, frameworks, and operating systems. The CycloneDX project provides standards in XML,
JSON, and Protocol Buffers, as well as a large collection of official and community supported tools that create or
interoperate with the standard.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/products/swid">SWID Tags</a> is an international XML-based standard used by commercial
software publishers. It has been published as the standard ISO/IEC 19770-2. The specification defines four types
of SWID tags: primary, patch, corpus, and supplemental, to describe a software component.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The SBOM should be integrated into the operations of the secure development lifecycle, especially for vulnerabilities
management. It should also evolve in time. When a software component is updated, a new SBOM must be created. The
elements described in this section are part of an ongoing effort. Improvements, such as SBOM integrity and
authenticity, will be added in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="vulnerability-identification">
<h3>Vulnerability identification<a class="headerlink" href="#vulnerability-identification" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vulnerability management must be continuous: from development to runtime, not only on the development process, but
during the entire life of the application, workload, or service. When a public vulnerability on a component is
released, an update of the component must be triggered. When an SBOM recording the code composition is provided,
the affected components are easier to identify. It is essential to remediate the affected components as soon as
possible, because the vulnerability can be exploited by attackers who can exploit code weaknesses.</p>
<p>The CVE and the CVSS must be used to identify vulnerabilities and their severity rating. The CVE identifies,
defines, and catalogues publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The CVSS is an open framework to
calculate the severity rating of the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Image scanning tools, including open-source tools such as Clair or Trivy, are useful for auditing images for
security vulnerabilities. The results of a vulnerabilities scan audit must be analysed carefully when it is applied
to a vendor offering packaged solutions. As patches are not detected by scanning tools, some components can be
detected as obsolete.</p>

<h3>Testing demarcation points<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-demarcation-points" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is not enough simply to secure all the potential points of entry and hope for the best. Any cloud infrastructure
architecture must be able, as much as possible, to be tested and confirmed to be protected from attack. The ability
to continuously test the infrastructure for vulnerabilities is critical for maintaining the highest possible level
of security. Testing needs to be done both from the inside and the outside of the systems and networks. Below is a
sample of some of the available testing methodologies and frameworks.</p>

<p>Ensuring that the security standards and best practices are incorporated into the cloud infrastructure and
architectures must be a shared responsibility. The telecommunications operators interested in building and
maintaining the infrastructures in support of their services, the application vendors developing the network
services to be used by the operators, and the cloud infrastructure vendors creating the infrastructures for
their telecommunications customers must all be responsible for performing this task. Each party needs to
incorporate security and testing components, and maintain operational processes and procedures to address
any security threats or incidents in an appropriate manner. Each of the stakeholders needs to contribute
to the creation of effective security for the cloud infrastructure.</p>

<section id="cloud-infrastructure-regulatory-compliance">
<h2>Cloud infrastructure regulatory compliance<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-infrastructure-regulatory-compliance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Evolving cloud adoption in the telecom industry, now encroaching on its inner sanctum of network services,
brings many benefits for the network operators and their partners, and ultimately to the consumers of
the telecommunication services. However, it also brings major compliance challenges. The telecommunication
industry players can mitigate these challenges by arming themselves with information about which laws they
need to comply with, why they need to comply with them, and how they can do this.</p>
<p>The costs of non-compliance can be heavy. Organisations may not only have to contend with hefty fines and
possible lawsuits, but they may also end up damaging their reputation and, consequently, losing customers,
which would, in turn, adversely affect revenues and profitability.</p>
<p>Compliance means that an operator’s systems, processes, and workflows align with the requirements mandated by the
regulatory regimes imposed by the relevant  governmental and industry regulatory bodies. The need for compliance
extends to the cloud. Therefore, operators must ensure that any data that is stored in their cloud infrastructure,
as well as data that is transferred to and from it, complies with all the relevant data protection laws, including
data residency and privacy laws.</p>
<p>To comply with the laws that apply to an operator’s business, the correct security controls need to be applied. The
applicable laws have specific rules and constraints about how companies can collect, store, and process data in
the cloud. To satisfy these constraints and ensure compliance, the telecom operators should work with their cloud
providers and other partners to implement tight controls. To speed up this process, the operators may start from
augmenting their existing  cybersecurity and information security frameworks to guide their security programs to
implement controls to secure their cloud infrastructure and to achieve regulatory compliance. This process can also
be assisted by support from the cloud providers and from third parties, who can offer their well-proven compliance
offerings, resources, audit reports, dashboards, and ecertain security controls as a service.</p>
<p>After implementing these controls, companies need to train their employees and partners to use the controls properly,
to protect data and maintain the required compliance posture. This is a critical requirement to maintain compliance
by enforcing relevant security guidelines in all aspects of everyday operations, as well as for ensuring a process
of regular assessment of the compliance posture.</p>
<p>Due to the localised nature of the regulatory regimes, this document may not provide any specific compliance
requirements.  However, some examples provided below may help in an operator’ compliance considerations.</p>
<p>Commonly used (in many jurisdictions) compliance audit reports are based on the SOC 2 report from the System and
Organization Controls (SOC) suite of services, standardised by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) and meant for service organizations, such as cloud providers. See
<a class="reference external" href="https://us.aicpa.org/content/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/sorhome.html">AICPA SOC</a> for
details. A SOC 2 report shows whether the cloud provider has implemented the security controls required to comply
with the AICPA’s five “trust services criteria”: security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity,
and privacy. Operators should request a SOC 2 report from their cloud  providers (public or internal to their
organisations). SOC 2 comprises two types: type 1 and type 2. A type 1 report shows the status and suitability
of the provider’s controls at a particular moment. A type 2 report shows the operational effectiveness of
these controls over a certain period. In cases where a cloud provider is not willing to share an SOC 2 report
because it may contain sensitive information, operators can ask for an SOC 3 report. This is intended as a
general-use report, but can still help to assess the provider’s compliance posture.</p>
<p>Some cloud providers also provide attestations (or, in the case of the private cloud, telecoms should seek
such attestations) to show which of their cloud services have achieved compliance with different frameworks,
such as SOC, but also commonly used frameworks, such as OWASP, ISAE, NIST, ETSI, and the ISO 27000 series,
as well as more geographically localised standard frameworks such as NIST (as used in the U.S.A.), ENISA,
GDPR, and ISM.</p>
<p>The use of the ISO 2700s, OWASP, ISAE, NIST, and ETSI security frameworks for the cloud infrastructure is
referenced in the Common Security Standards and Compliance with Standards sections.</p>
<p>Examples of regulatory frameworks are presented below. It is intended to expand this list of examples in
future releases to cover more jurisdictions and to accommodate changes in the rapidly evolving security and
regulatory landscape.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and security audit<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-and-security-audit" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The platform is assumed to provide configurable alerting and notification capabilities. The operator is assumed to have
systems, policies, and procedures in place to act on alerts and notifications in a timely fashion. In the following,
the monitoring and logging capabilities can trigger alerts and notifications for appropriate action. In general, it is
recommended to have the same security monitoring and auditing capabilities in both production and non-production
environments. However, we distinguish between the requirements for the production platform (Prod-Platform) and the
non-production platform (NonProd-Platform), as some of the requirements may, in practice, need to differ. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#security-of-production-and-non-production-environments"><span class="std std-ref">Security of production and non-production environments</span></a> for a general discussion of this
topic. In the table below, when a requirement mentions only Prod-Platform, it is assumed that this requirement is
optional for the NonProd-Platform. If a requirement does not mention either platform, it is assumed that it is valid
for both the Prod-Platform and the NonProd-Platform.</p>
