<p>The purpose of this chapter is to define the capabilities required of the infrastructure to ensure it is effectively
supported, maintained and otherwise lifecycle-managed by Operations teams. This includes requirements relating to the
need to be able to maintain infrastructure services “in-service” without impacting the applications and workloads,
whilst minimising human labour. It shall also capture any exceptions and related assumptions.</p>
<p>There are three main business operating frameworks that are commonly known and used across the Telecommunications
industry related to the topics in this chapter:</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Lifecycle Model<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-lifecycle-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model discussed in this chapter is focused on the Cloud Infrastructure lifecycle. It provides a complementary view to
the cloud consumption model presented in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>The following diagrams provide mapping between different stages of the infrastructure lifecycle across all layers of the
stack, to owners of infrastructure and cloud and the tenant as the consumer of the cloud services, in three very
different scenarios: applications running as containers within virtual machines (CaaS on IaaS scenario), application
running as containers on bare metal (CaaS on BM scenario) and a more traditional view of applications running as VNFs
within virtual machines (IaaS scenario). The diagrams also define also the scope of the Infrastructure LCM Automation for each of
these scenarios. The dotted lines symbolise the interactions between the layers of each of the model.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="infrastructure-automation-in-caas-on-iaas-scenario">

<p><span class="caption-text">Infrastructure LCM in CaaS on IaaS scenario</span><a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-automation-in-caas-on-iaas-scenario" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the CaaS on IaaS scenario, the Infrastructure LCM scope covers the Site/Physical layer,  IaaS layer and CaaS
layer. From the lifecycle perspective (the left hand side of the diagram), Site/Physical layer is entirely owned by the
Infrastructure Owner, the virtualised infrastructure layer (IaaS) is shared between the Infrastructure Owner and the
Cloud Provider. Similarly,  the container orchestration layer (CaaS) is shared between the Cloud Provider and the
Cloud Consumer / Tenant.   These relationships can be illustrated by a situation, where a telecom operator owns the
physical infrastructure on which an external cloud provider runs the virtualisation software (hypervisor).
Sharing CaaS layer between the Cloud Provider and the Cloud Consumer reflects the fact that the container
management/orchestration software like Kubernetes is lifecycled by the Cloud Provider (for instance when scaling out
containers) but also by the Cloud Consumer because of the very close lifecycle relationship between an application and
a container in this model. For instance, destroying an application means also destroying related containers, Hence CaaS
can be also considered as a part of the Application Orchestration layer.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="infrastructure-automation-in-caas-on-bm-scenario">
<img alt="&quot;Infrastructure Automation in CaaS on BM scenario&quot;" src="../_images/RM-Ch09-LCM-Automation-CNF-on-BM.png" />

<p><span class="caption-text">Infrastructure LCM in CaaS on BM scenario</span><a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-automation-in-caas-on-bm-scenario" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main and obvious difference in the CaaS on BM scenario is lack of the IaaS layer, and hence the scope of the
Infrastructure LCM and its automation is limited to only two layers: Site/Physical and CaaS.  From the lifecycle ownership
perspective, the CaaS layer is now shared not only between the Cloud Provider and the Cloud Consumer (for the same
reasons as in the CaaS on IaaS scenario) but also with the Infrastructure Owner.  The latter observation is related to
the fact that in the bare metal deployments lacking the hypervisor separation, the CaaS layer is much more dependent on
the underlying physical infrastructure.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="infrastructure-automation-in-iaas-scenario">

<p><span class="caption-text">Infrastructure LCM in IaaS scenario</span><a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-automation-in-iaas-scenario" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this “classical” scenario the scope of the Infrastructure LCM and its automation is defined by the Site/Physical and IaaS layers.
From the lifecycle perspective the ownership of IaaS is shared between the Infrastructure Owner and the Cloud Provider.
This scenario is characterised by a clear separation between the lifecycle (and hence its automation) of infrastructure
and the application lifecycle owned by the Cloud Consumer / Tenant in the role of the Application Owner.</p>

<section id="configuration-and-lifecycle-management">
<h2>Configuration and Lifecycle Management<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-and-lifecycle-management" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Configuration management is concerned with defining the configuration of infrastructure and its components, and tracking
(observing) the running configuration of that infrastructure, and any changes that take place. Modern configuration
management practices such as desired state configuration management also mean that any changes from the desired state
that are observed (aka the delta) are rectified by an orchestration / fulfilment component of the configuration
management system. This “closed loop” mitigates against configuration drift in the infrastructure and its components.
Our recommendation is to keep these closed loops as small as possible to reduce complexity and risk of error.
<code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Configuration</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Lifecycle</span> <span class="pre">Management</span></code> shows the configuration management “loop” and how this relates to
lifecycle management.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id1">

<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Configuration and Lifecycle Management</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The initial desired state might be for 10 hosts with a particular set of configuration attributes, including the version
of the hypervisor and any management agents. The configuration management system will take that as input (1) and
configure the infrastructure as required (2). It will then observe the current state periodically over time (3) and in
the case of a difference between the desired state and the observed state it will calculate the delta (4) and
re-configure the infrastructure (5). For each lifecycle stage (create, update, delete) this loop takes place - for
example if an update to the hypervisor version is defined in the desired state, the configuration management system will
calculate the delta (e.g. v1 –&gt; v2) and re-configure the infrastructure as required.</p>
<p>However, the key requirements for the infrastructure and infrastructure management are those interfaces and reference
points in the red box - where configuration is <strong>set</strong>, and where it is <strong>observed</strong>. Table 9-2 lists the main
components and capabilities required in order to manage the configuration and lifecycle of those components.</p>

<h2>Capacity Management<a class="headerlink" href="#capacity-management" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Capacity Management is a potentially wide ranging process that includes taking demand across lines of business,
analysing data about the infrastructure that is running, and calculating when additional infrastructure might be
required, or when infrastructure might need to be decommissioned.</p>
<p>As such the requirements for Capacity Management on the infrastructure are covered by the Assurance and Configuration
and Lifecycle Management sections below. The Assurance section deals with the collection of data - there is no reason to
consider that this would be done by a different mechanism for Capacity Management as it is for Assurance - and the
Configuration and Lifecycle Management section deals with the changes being made to the infrastructure hardware,
software, and management components (e.g. changing of number of hypervisor hosts from 10 to 12).</p>
</section>
<section id="assurance">
<h2>Assurance<a class="headerlink" href="#assurance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assurance is concerned with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The proactive and reactive maintenance activities that are required to ensure infrastructure services are available
as per defined performance and availability levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous monitoring of the status and performance of individual components and of the service as a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection and analysis of performance data, which is used to identify potential issues including the ability to
resolve the issue with no customer impact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are the following requirement types:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Data collection from all components, e.g.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to collect data relating to events (transactions, security events, physical interface up/down events,
warning events, error events, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to collect data relating to component status (up/down, physical temperature, disk speed, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to collect data relating to component performance (used CPU resources, storage throughput, network
bandwidth in/out, API transactions, transaction response times, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Capabilities of the Infrastructure Management Software to allow for in-service maintenance of the Infrastructure
Software and Hardware under its management, e.g.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to mark a physical compute node as being in some sort of “maintenance mode” and for the Infrastructure
Management Software to ensure all running workloads are moved off or rescheduled on to other available nodes
(after checking that there is sufficient capacity) before marking the node as being ready for whatever maintenance
activity needs to be performed</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to co-ordinate, automate, and allow the declarative input of in-service software component upgrades -
such as internal orchestration and scheduler components in the Infrastructure Management Software</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the above only refers to components - it is expected that any “service” level assurance doesn’t add any
further requirements onto the infrastructure, but rather takes the data extracted and builds service models based on the
knowledge it has of the services being offered.</p>
<section id="telemetry-and-observability">
<h3>Telemetry and Observability<a class="headerlink" href="#telemetry-and-observability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Operating complex distributed systems, such as a Telco network, is a challenging job that is becoming
even harder as the technology sophistication and the operational quality requirements grow. There are multiple reasons
why it is so, but they originate in the nature of the system concept. To reach the ability of providing Telco services,
a complex system is decomposed into multiple different functional blocks, called network functions. Internal
communication between the diverse network functions of a distributed system is based on message exchange. To formalize
this communication, clearly defined interfaces are introduced, and protocols designed. Even though the architecture of
a Telco network is systematically formalized on the worldwide level, heterogeneity of services, functions, interfaces,
and protocols cannot be avoided. By adding the multi-vendor approach in implementation of Telco networks, the outcome is
a system with a remarkably high level of complexity that requires significant effort for managing and operating
it.</p>
<p>A large and complex ecosystem of end-user services requires a formalized approach
for achieving high reliability and scalability. The discipline which applies well-known practices of
software engineering to operations is called Site Reliability Engineering. It was conceived at Google, as a means to
overcome limitations of the common DevOps approach.</p>
<p>Common support system (such as, OSS – Operation Support System, BSS – Business Support System) requirements are redefined,
driven by introduction of new technologies in computing infrastructure and modern data centres with abstraction of
resources – known as virtualization and cloud computing. This brings many advantages – such as easy scaling, error
recovery, reaching a high level of operational autonomy etc., but also many new challenges in the Telecom network
management space. Those novel challenges are mostly directed towards the dynamical nature of the system, orientation
towards microservices instead of a silo approach, and huge amounts of data which have to be processed in order to
understand the internal status of the system. Hence the need of improved ways to monitor systems - observability.</p>
<section id="why-observability">
<h4>Why Observability<a class="headerlink" href="#why-observability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Knowing the status of all services and functions at all levels in a cloud based service offering is essential to act
fast, ideally pro-actively before users notice and, most importantly, before they call the help desk.</p>
<p>Common approach to understand the aforementioned Telco network status in conventional non-cloud environments is referred
to as monitoring. Usually it would include metric information related to resources, such as CPU, memory, HDD, Network
I/O, but also business related technical key performance indicators (KPIs) such as number of active users, number of
registrations, etc. This monitoring data are represented as a time series, retrieved in regular intervals, usually with
granulation of 5 to 30 minutes. In addition, asynchronous messages such as alarms and notifications are exposed by the
monitored systems in order to provide information about foreseen situations. It is worth noting that metric data provide
approximation of the health of the system, while the alarms and notifications try to bring more information about the
problem. In general, they provide information about known unknowns - anticipated situations occurring at random time.
However, this would very rarely be sufficient information for understanding the problem (RCA - root cause analysis),
therefore it is necessary to retrieve more data related to the problem - logs and network signalization. Logs are
application output information to get more granular information about the code execution. Network packet captures/traces
are useful since telecommunication networks are distributed systems where components communicate utilizing various
protocols, and the communication can be examined to get details of the problem.</p>
<p>As the transition towards cloud environments takes place simultaneously with the introduction of DevOps mindset, the
conventional monitoring approach becomes suboptimal. Cloud environments allow greater flexibility as the microservice
architecture is embraced to bring improvements in operability, therefore the automation can be utilized to a higher
extent than ever before. Automation in telecom networks usually supposes actions based on decisions derived from system
output data (system observation). In order to derive useful decisions, data with rich context are necessary. Obviously,
the conventional monitoring approach has to be improved in order to retrieve sufficient data, not only from the wider
context, but also without delays - as soon as data are produced or available. The new, enhanced approach was introduced
as a concept of observability, borrowed from the control theory which states that it is possible to make conclusions
about a system’s internal state based on external outputs.</p>
<p>This requires the collection of alarms and telemetry data from the physical layer (wires), the cloud infrastructure up
to the network, applications and services (virtualized network functions (VNF)) running on top of the cloud
infrastructure, typically isolated by tenants.</p>
<p>Long term trending data are essential for capacity planning purposes and typically collected, aggregated and kept over
the full lifespan. To keep the amount of data collected manageable, automatic data reduction algorithms are typically
used, e.g. by merging data points from the smallest intervals to more granular intervals.</p>
<p>The telco cloud infrastructure typically consists of one or more regional data centres, central offices, and edge sites.
These are managed from redundant central management sites, each hosted in their own data centres.</p>
<p>The network services and applications deployed on a Telco Cloud, and the Telco Cloud infrastructure are usually managed
by separate teams, and, thus, the monitoring solution must be capable of keeping the access to the monitoring data
isolated between tenants and Cloud Infrastructure operations. Some monitoring data from the Cloud Infrastructure layer
must selectively be available to tenant monitoring applications in order to correlate, say, the Network
Functions/Services data with the underlying cloud infrastructure data.</p>

<section id="data-categories">
<h4>Data categories<a class="headerlink" href="#data-categories" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are four main observability categories: metrics, events, logs and traces:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Metrics</strong> or telemetry report counters and gauge levels and can either be pulled periodically e.g. via SNMP or
REST, or pushed as streams using gRPC, NETCONF, which receivers registered for certain sensors, or by registering as
a publisher to a message broker. These messages must be structured in order to get parsed successfully.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Events</strong> indicate state variance beyond some specified threshold, are categorized by severity, often with a
description of what just
happened. Most common transport protocol is SNMP with its trap and inform messages). These messages are generated by
network elements (physical and logical). In addition, the messages can also be generated by monitoring applications
with statically configured thresholds or dynamically by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - generally, they are
describing anomalies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logs</strong> are a record messages generated by software for most devices (compute and network) and virtual
applications and transported over SYSLOG and tend to come in high volumes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Traces</strong> are end-to-end signalling messages (events) created to fulfil execution of requests on
the distributed system services. OTHER WORDS: Traces are all action points executed in
order to provide response to the request set to the distributed system service. Even the call
can be thought of as a request which starts by INVITE message of the SIP protocol.</p></li>

<section id="where-to-send-the-data">
<h4>Where to send the data<a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-send-the-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>If the observability data have to be sent from their sources (or producers) to specific destinations (or consumers),
then this creates high degree of dependency between producers and consumers, and is extremely prone to errors,
especially in case of configuration changes. Ideally, the data producers must not be impacted with any change in the
data consumers and vice versa.
This is achieved by decoupling data producers from data consumers through the use of Brokers. The Producers always send
their data to the same endpoint - the Broker. While the Consumers register with the Broker for data that is of interest
to them and always receive their data from the Broker.</p>
</section>
<section id="which-protocol-interface-and-format-to-use">
<h4>Which protocol, interface, and format to use<a class="headerlink" href="#which-protocol-interface-and-format-to-use" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>While protocols and interfaces are dictated by the selection of the message broker (common data bus) system, data format
is usually customizable according to the needs of users. The concept of Schema Registry mechanism, well known in the
world of big data, is helpful here to make sure that message structures and formats are consistently used.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-architecture">
<h4>The Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#the-architecture" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In geographically dispersed large cloud deployments, a given telco cloud may have several cloud infrastructure
components as well a large set of virtualized workloads (VNF/CNFs). It is important to monitor all of these workloads
and infrastructure components. Furthermore, it is even more important to be able to correlate between the metrics
provided by these entities to determine the performance and/or issues in such deployments.</p>
<p>The cloud deployment tends to shrink and expand based upon the customer demand. Therefore, an architecture is required
that can scale on demand and does not force a strong tie between various entities. This means, the workloads and cloud
infrastructure components that provide telemetry and performance metrics must not be burdened to discover each other.
The capacity (e.g. speed, storage) of one component must not force overrun or underrun situations that would cause
critical data to be lost or delayed to a point to render them useless.</p>
<p>Operators in charge of the cloud infrastructure (physical infra plus virtualization platform) require very detailed
alarms and metrics to efficiently run their platform. While they need indicators about how well or poorly individual
virtual machines and containers run, they don’t need a view inside these workloads. In fact, what and how workloads do
should not be accessible to NFVI operators. The architecture must allow for different consumers to grant or deny access
to available resources.</p>
<p>Multiple workloads or network services can be deployed onto one or more sites. These workloads require logical
separation so that their metrics don’t mix by accident or simply based on security and privacy requirements. This is
achieved by deploying these workloads within their own tenant space. All virtualization platforms offer such isolation
down to virtual networks per tenant.</p>

<section id="push-vs-pull">
<span id="id3"></span><h4>Push vs. Pull<a class="headerlink" href="#push-vs-pull" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Two widely deployed models for providing telemetry data are pull and push.</p>
<section id="pull-model">
<h5>Pull Model<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Typical characteristics of a pull model are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The consumers are required to discover the producers of the data</p></li>
<li><p>Once the producers are identified, there should be a tight relationship (synchronization) between the producer and
consumer. This makes the systems very complex in terms of configuration and management. For example, if a producer
moves to a different location or reboots/restarts, the consumer must re-discover the producer and bind their
relationship again.</p></li>
<li><p>Data are pulled explicitly by the consumer. The consumer must have appropriate bandwidth, compute power, and storage
to deal with this data - example SNMP pull/walks</p></li>
<li><p>A problem with Pull is that both consumers and producers have to have means for load/performance regulation in cases
where the set of consumers overload the pull request serving capabilities of the producer.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="push-model">
<h5>Push Model<a class="headerlink" href="#push-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Typical characteristics of a push model are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Declarative definition of destination - The producers of data know explicitly where to stream/push their data</p></li>
<li><p>A “well known” data broker is utilized - all consumers and producers know about it through declarative definition.
The data broker can be a bus such as RabitMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar</p></li>
<li><p>No restrictions on the bandwidth or data storage constraints on producers or consumers. Producers produce the data and
stream/push it to the broker and consumers pull the data from the broker. No explicit sync is required between
producers and consumers.</p></li>
<li><p>LCM (Life Cycle Management) events, such as moves, reboot/restarts, of consumers or producers have no impact on
others.</p></li>
<li><p>Producers and consumers can be added/removed at will. No impact on the system. This makes this model very flexible and
scalable and better suited for large (or small) geographically dispersed telco clouds.</p></li>

<h3>Infrastructure LCM Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-lcm-automation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a typical telecom operator environment, infrastructure Life Cycle Management is highly complex and error-prone. The
environment, with its multiple vendors and products, is maintenance expensive (both in terms of time and costs) because
of the need for complex planning, testing, and the out-of-business-hours execution required to perform disruptive
maintenance (e.g., upgrades) and to mitigate outages to mission-critical applications. Processes and tooling for
infrastructure management across hybrid environments create additional complexity due to the different levels of access
to infrastructure: hands-on access to the on-premise infrastructure but only restricted access to consumable services
offered by public clouds.</p>
<p>Life cycle operations, such as software or hardware upgrades (including complex and risky firmware updates), typically
involve time-consuming manual research and substantive testing to ensure that an upgrade is available, required, or
needed, and does not conflict with the current versions of other components.  In a complex and at-scale Hybrid
Multi-Cloud environment, consisting of multiple on-premise and public clouds, such a manual process is ineffective and,
in many cases, impossible to execute in a controlled manner.  Hence, the need for automation.</p>
<p>The goals of LCM are to provide a reliable administration of a system from its provisioning, through its operational
stage, to its final retirement.</p>
<p>Key functions of Infrastructure LCM are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hybrid, Multi-Cloud support, that is, LCM works across physical, virtual, and cloud environments, supporting
on-premise, cloud, and distributed environments</p></li>
<li><p>Complete system life cycle control (Plan/Design, Build, Provision, Operate/Manage, Retire, Recycle/Scrap)</p></li>
<li><p>Enablement for automation of most system maintenance tasks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key benefits of the Infrastructure LCM Automation are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Agility: standardisation of the LCM process by writing and running IaaC allows to quickly and easily develop, stage,
and produce environments</p></li>
<li><p>Operational Consistency: automation of lifecycle  results in consistently maintaining desired state, reduces the
possibility of errors and decreases the chances of incompatibility issues within the infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Human related Risks Mitigation: automation reduces risks related to human errors, rogue activities, and safeguards
the institutional knowledge from leakage in case any employee leaves the organization</p></li>
<li><p>Higher Efficiency: achieved by minimizing human inaccuracies and eliminating the lack of knowledge about
infrastructure installed base and its configuration, using the CI/CD techniques adapted to infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Cost/time Saving: engineers save up on time and cost which can be wisely invested in performing higher-value jobs;
additional cost savings on cloud more optimal use of cloud resources using LCM Automation</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Infrastructure LCM Automation Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-lcm-automation-framework" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Essential foundation functional blocks for Infrastructure LCM automation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Representation Model</p></li>
<li><p>Repository functions</p></li>
<li><p>Available Software Versions and Dependencies</p></li>
<li><p>Orchestration Engine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automated LCM uses Representation Model to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>abstract various automation technologies</p></li>
<li><p>promote evolution from automation understood as automation of human tasks to autonomous systems using intent-based,
declarative automation, supported by evolving AI/ML technologies</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automated LCM uses Repository functions to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>store and manage configuration data</p></li>
<li><p>store and manage metrics related data such as event data,  alert data, and performance data</p></li>
<li><p>maintain currency of data by the use of discovery of current versions of software modules</p></li>
<li><p>track and account for all systems, assets, subscriptions (monitoring)</p></li>
<li><p>provide an inventory of all virtual and physical assets</p></li>
<li><p>provide a topological view of interconnected resources</p></li>
<li><p>support network design function</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automated LCM uses available IAC Software Versions and Dependencies component to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>store information about available software versions, software patches and dependency expectations</p></li>
<li><p>determine the recommended version of a software item (such as firmware) and dependencies on other items in the node
to ensure compliance and maintain the system integrity</p></li>
<li><p>determine the recommended versions of foundation software running on the cluster</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automated LCM uses Orchestration Engine to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>dynamically remediate dependencies during the change process to optimise outcome</p></li>
<li><p>ensure that the system is consistent across its life cycle by maintaining it in accordance with the intent templates</p></li>

<section id="lcm-automation-principles-best-practice">
<h4>LCM Automation Principles / Best Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#lcm-automation-principles-best-practice" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The following principles should guide best practice in the area of the Infrastructure LCM Automation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Everything Codified: use explicit coding to configure files not only for initial provisioning but also as a single
source of truth for the whole infrastructure lifecycle, to ensure consistency with the intent configuration templates
and to eliminate configuration drift</p></li>
<li><p>Version Controlled: use stringent version control for the infrastructure code to allow proper lifecycle automation</p></li>
<li><p>Self-Documentation: code itself represents the updated documentation of the infrastructure, to minimise the
documentation maintenance burden and to ensure the documentation currency</p></li>
<li><p>Code Modularisation: apply to IaaC principles of the microservices architecture where the modular units of code can be
independently deployed and lifecycled in an automated fashion</p></li>
<li><p>Immutability: IT infrastructure components are required to be replaced for each deployment during the system lifecycle
to be consistent with immutable infrastructure to avoid configuration drift and to restrict the impact of undocumented
changes in the stack</p></li>
<li><p>Automated Testing: is the key for the error-free post-deployment lifecycle processes and to eliminate lengthy manual
testing processes</p></li>
<li><p>Unified Automation: use the same Infrastructure LCM Automation templates, toolsets and procedures across different
environments such as Dev, Test, QA and Prod, to ensure consistency of the lifecycle results and to reduce operational
costs</p></li>
<li><p>Security Automation: security of infrastructure is critical for the overall security, dictating to use consistent
automated security procedures for the threat detection, investigation and remediation through all infrastructure
lifecyle stages and all environments</p></li>

<section id="software-onboarding-automation">
<h4>Software Onboarding Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#software-onboarding-automation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>For software deployment, as far as Cloud Infrastructure services or workloads are concerned, automation is the core of
DevOps concept. Automation allows to eliminate manual processes, reducing human errors and speeding software
deployments. The prerequisite is to install CI/CD tools chain to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Build, package, test application/software</p></li>
<li><p>Store environment’s parameters and configurations</p></li>
<li><p>Automate the delivery and deployment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The CI/CD pipeline is used to deploy, test and update the Cloud Infrastructure services, and also to onboard workloads
hosted on the infrastructure. Typically, this business process consists of the following key phases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Tenant Engagement and Software Evaluation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In this phase the request from the tenant to host a workload on the Cloud Infrastructure platform is assessed and a
decision made on whether to proceed with the hosting request.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Cloud infrastructure software needs to be updated or installed, an evaluation is made of the impacts
(including to tenants) and if it is OK to proceed</p></li>
<li><p>This phase may also involve the tenant accessing a pre-staging environment to perform their own evaluation and/or
pre-staging activities in preparation for later onboarding phases.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Software Packaging:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The main outcome of this phase is to produce the software deployable image and the deployment manifests (such as
TOSCA blueprints or HEAT templates or Helm charts) that will define the Cloud Infrastructure service attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>The software packaging can be automated or performed by designated personnel, through self-service capabilities
(for tenants) or by the Cloud Infrastructure Operations team.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Software Validation and Certification:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In this phase the software is deployed and tested to validate it against the service design and other Operator
specific acceptance criteria, as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Software validation and certification should be automated using CI/CD toolsets / pipelines and Test as a Service
(TaaS) capabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Publish Software:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tenant Workloads: After the software is certified the final onboarding process phase is for it to be published to
the Cloud Infrastructure production catalogue from where it can be instantiated on the Cloud Infrastructure
platform by the tenant.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud Infrastructure software: After the software is certified, it is scheduled for deployment in concurrence with
the user community.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All phases described above can be automated using technology specific toolsets and procedures. Hence, details of such
automation are left for the technology specific Reference Architecture and Reference Implementation specifications.</p>

<h4>CI/CD Design Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#ci-cd-design-requirements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A couple of CI/CD pipeline properties and rules must be agreed between the
different actors to allow smoothly deploy and test the cloud infrastructures
and the hosted network functions whatever if the jobs operate open-source or
proprietary software. They all prevent that specific deployment or testing
operations force a particular CI/CD design or even worse ask to deploy a full
dedicated CI/CD toolchain for a particular network service.</p>
<p>At first glance, the deployment and test job must not basically ask for a
specific CI/CD tools such as <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">`Jenkins`__</span></a> <span id="id4">[]</span> or
<a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id9">`Gitlab CI/CD`__</span></a> <span id="id5">[]</span>. But they are many other
ways where deployment and test jobs can constraint the end users from the
build servers to the artefact management. Any manual operation is discouraged
whatever it’s about the deployment or the test resources.</p>
<p>The following requirements also aims at deploying smoothly and easily all CI/CD
toolchains via simple playbooks as targeted by the Reference Conformance
